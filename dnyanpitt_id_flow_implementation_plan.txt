DYANPITT ID FLOW CHANGE - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
====================================================

OVERVIEW:
=========
Moving Dyanpitt ID generation from registration to after first successful membership payment.

FLOW CHANGE:
============
OLD: Email → Profile → Dyanpitt ID Generated → Dashboard → Optional Membership
NEW: Email → Profile → Dashboard → Mandatory Membership → Payment → Dyanpitt ID Generated → Logout → Login with ID

KEY DECISIONS:
==============
✓ Users login with email/password before getting Dyanpitt ID
✓ Email is primary identifier until Dyanpitt ID is generated
✓ Membership completion is MANDATORY to get Dyanpitt ID
✓ After payment: Congratulations → Force logout → Login with new Dyanpitt ID
✓ After Dyanpitt ID generation: BOTH email AND Dyanpitt ID can be used for login
✓ Dyanpitt ID becomes PRIMARY identifier after generation (email becomes secondary)
✓ 10-day cleanup period for incomplete registrations
✓ Database will be cleaned (affects existing users)
