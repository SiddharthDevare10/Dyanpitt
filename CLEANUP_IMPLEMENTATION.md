# Temporary User Data Cleanup Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic cleanup of temporary user data 1 minute after successful registration to prevent database pollution and ensure data integrity.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. User Model Updates (`backend/models/User.js`)
- **Added `cleanupAt` field**: Timestamp field for scheduling automatic cleanup
- **Added TTL Index**: MongoDB TTL (Time To Live) index for automatic document expiration
- **Added Instance Methods**:
  - `scheduleCleanup()`: Sets cleanup timestamp 1 minute from now
  - `cancelCleanup()`: Removes cleanup timestamp when registration completes
- **Added Static Method**:
  - `cleanupExpiredTempUsers()`: Manually removes expired temporary users

### 2. Cleanup Service (`backend/services/cleanupService.js`)
- **Periodic Cleanup**: Runs every 1 minute to clean expired temporary users
- **Manual Cleanup**: Provides manual trigger for immediate cleanup
- **Service Management**: Start/stop functionality with graceful shutdown
- **Status Monitoring**: Get current service status

### 3. Registration Flow Updates (`backend/routes/auth.js`)
- **Schedule Cleanup**: When temporary user is created during OTP sending
- **Cancel Cleanup**: When user completes full registration
- **Admin Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/cleanup-temp-users`: Manual cleanup trigger
  - `GET /api/auth/cleanup-status`: Service status check

### 4. Server Integration (`backend/server.js`)
- **Auto-start**: Cleanup service starts automatically with server
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly stops cleanup service on server shutdown

## How It Works

### Registration Flow
1. **User requests OTP** → Temporary user created with fake data + `cleanupAt` timestamp
2. **User verifies OTP** → Temporary user marked as verified
3. **User completes registration** → Real data assigned + `cleanupAt` removed
4. **If user abandons** → Automatic cleanup after 1 minute

### Cleanup Mechanisms
1. **MongoDB TTL Index**: Automatically removes documents when `cleanupAt` expires
2. **Periodic Service**: Runs every 1 minute to catch any missed cleanups
3. **Manual Cleanup**: Available via API endpoint for admin use

## Cleanup Criteria
Removes users that match ANY of these conditions:
- Email matches pattern `temp_*@temp.local` AND `isEmailVerified: false`
- Has `pendingEmail` AND `isEmailVerified: false` AND created > 1 minute ago

## Testing
✅ **Test Results**: Successfully created and cleaned up temporary user
- Created test temporary user
- Verified cleanup function removes expired users
- Confirmed database count reduces after cleanup

## API Endpoints

### Manual Cleanup
```bash
POST /api/auth/cleanup-temp-users
```
Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Cleanup completed successfully",
  "deletedCount": 5,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Service Status
```bash
GET /api/auth/cleanup-status
```
Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cleanupService": {
    "isRunning": true,
    "hasInterval": true
  },
  "message": "Cleanup service is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Database Hygiene**: Prevents accumulation of abandoned temporary records
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Automatic cleanup without manual intervention
3. **Data Integrity**: Ensures only completed registrations remain in database
4. **ID Conservation**: Prevents wastage of sequential Dyanpitt IDs
5. **Monitoring**: Admin endpoints for service management and status

## Configuration
- **Cleanup Interval**: 1 minute (configurable in server.js)
- **Expiry Time**: 1 minute after creation
- **Auto-start**: Enabled by default with server startup
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Cleanup service stops with server

## Production Considerations
- Admin endpoints should be protected with authentication
- Monitor cleanup logs for unusual patterns
- Consider adjusting cleanup interval based on load
- TTL index provides automatic failsafe even if service fails
