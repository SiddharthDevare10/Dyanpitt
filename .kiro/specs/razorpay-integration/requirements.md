# Requirements Document - Razorpay Payment Integration

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Razorpay payment gateway into the Dyanpitt application to replace the current mock payment implementation. The integration will enable users to make actual payments for membership bookings and handle payment verification, webhooks, and order management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Payment Gateway Setup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Razorpay payment gateway so that the application can process real payments securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL connect to Razorpay API using valid credentials
2. WHEN payment processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL use Razorpay's secure payment interface
3. IF Razorpay credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL log appropriate errors and fallback gracefully
4. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL use Razorpay test mode credentials
5. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL use Razorpay live mode credentials

### Requirement 2: Order Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my booking details to be converted into a payment order so that I can proceed with secure payment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes booking details THEN the system SHALL create a Razorpay order with correct amount and currency
2. WHEN creating an order THEN the system SHALL include booking metadata (membership type, duration, user details)
3. WHEN order creation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message to the user
4. WHEN order is created successfully THEN the system SHALL store order details in database for tracking
5. WHEN order amount is calculated THEN it SHALL match the pricing data exactly

### Requirement 3: Payment Processing Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to make payments through a secure and user-friendly interface so that I can complete my membership purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment screen loads THEN it SHALL display Razorpay checkout interface with correct order details
2. WHEN user initiates payment THEN Razorpay modal SHALL open with payment options (UPI, cards, netbanking, wallets)
3. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL receive payment confirmation from Razorpay
4. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and allow retry
5. WHEN payment is cancelled THEN the system SHALL handle cancellation gracefully without data corruption

### Requirement 4: Payment Verification and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all payments to be verified for authenticity so that the system prevents fraudulent transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment is completed THEN the system SHALL verify payment signature using Razorpay webhook
2. WHEN payment verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL update booking status to confirmed
3. WHEN payment verification fails THEN the system SHALL mark payment as suspicious and not confirm booking
4. WHEN webhook is received THEN the system SHALL authenticate it using Razorpay webhook secret
5. WHEN payment status changes THEN the system SHALL log all payment events for audit trail

### Requirement 5: User Experience and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback about my payment status so that I know whether my membership is confirmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect user to success page with booking confirmation
2. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL show failure page with retry options
3. WHEN payment is processing THEN the system SHALL show loading state with appropriate messaging
4. WHEN booking is confirmed THEN the system SHALL generate Dyanpitt ID if not already assigned
5. WHEN payment is complete THEN the system SHALL send confirmation email to user

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle payment errors gracefully so that I don't lose my booking data or get charged incorrectly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network error occurs during payment THEN the system SHALL allow user to retry without creating duplicate orders
2. WHEN payment gateway is down THEN the system SHALL display maintenance message with alternative contact information
3. WHEN partial payment occurs THEN the system SHALL handle refund process automatically
4. WHEN user closes payment modal THEN the system SHALL preserve booking data for later completion
5. WHEN payment timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL cancel the order and free up the booking slot

### Requirement 7: Admin Payment Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view and manage all payment transactions so that I can handle customer support and financial reconciliation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin accesses payment dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all transactions with status and details
2. WHEN payment dispute occurs THEN admin SHALL be able to view complete payment trail and booking details
3. WHEN refund is required THEN admin SHALL be able to initiate refund through the system
4. WHEN payment fails THEN admin SHALL receive notification for manual intervention if needed
5. WHEN financial reports are needed THEN the system SHALL provide payment analytics and summaries

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Booking Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want the payment process to integrate seamlessly with my existing booking flow so that my experience is smooth and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user completes booking form THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to payment without data loss
2. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL update user's membership status and booking completion flags
3. WHEN user has existing incomplete booking THEN the system SHALL allow payment completion without re-entering details
4. WHEN payment is confirmed THEN the system SHALL trigger all post-payment processes (ID generation, email notifications)
5. WHEN user returns to dashboard THEN it SHALL reflect the updated membership status and payment confirmation
